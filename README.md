# 🧮 Math Quiz Game in C++ 🎮

> **A fun and interactive console-based quiz game where players solve math problems in multiple levels! 🌟**  

---

## 🌟 Project Overview  
This **C++ project** simulates a Math Quiz game 🧠, where players answer questions with different difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Mixed). Players can choose the number of questions and the type of mathematical operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, or Mixed). The game checks the answers and provides real-time feedback. Players are given the option to replay the game.

## ⚙️ How It Works  

### Core Components  
1. **Player Input**:  
   - The player selects the number of questions, difficulty level, and operation type.  
   - The player answers math questions, which vary based on difficulty and operation type.  

2. **Question Generation**:  
   - **Random Numbers**: Each question consists of two numbers chosen randomly within specific ranges based on the difficulty.  
   - **Operations**: The program can generate addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or random combinations.  

3. **Answer Checking**:  
   - After the player answers, the program checks the correctness of the answer.  
   - Results are displayed immediately with color feedback (Green for correct, Red for wrong).  

4. **Scoring and Summary**:  
   - The total number of correct and wrong answers are tracked.  
   - The player’s result is displayed as either "PASS" or "FAIL" based on the number of correct answers.
